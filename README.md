# Weight-Tracking-App
The Weight Tracking App is designed to help users monitor their weight and track their progress over time. It offers essential features like secure user login, database management, and optional SMS notifications. The app is primarily targeted at individuals who want to keep track of their weight, set goals, and observe changes in their progress. Users can log in using a username and password or create a new account if they don’t have one. The app securely stores login credentials in an SQLite database and allows users to log, view, and track their weight entries. It also includes a feature that sends SMS notifications to alert users when they reach certain milestones, such as achieving a target weight. This feature is optional, and users must grant permission to receive notifications; if declined, the app will continue to function without them. The app relies on an SQLite database to store user data, including weight records, and supports basic operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting entries.

In terms of design, the app prioritizes simplicity and user-friendliness. The home screen enables users to input their daily weight and set a target weight while displaying past weight entries for easy reference. The login screen offers a straightforward way for users to enter their credentials, while the SMS permission screen requests access to send notifications. The design is streamlined to keep the app intuitive and easy to navigate, drawing inspiration from other successful apps to ensure a seamless user experience. The app is compatible with Android 5.0 (Lollipop) and above, making it accessible to a wide range of users. It only requests necessary permissions, such as storage access for saving data and SMS permissions for notifications, ensuring minimal invasiveness.

The development process was broken down into manageable steps, with each screen being worked on individually and tested before moving on to the next. This approach allowed for efficient progress and ensured that each component functioned properly. Moving forward, further testing will be conducted on different devices, such as tablets and computers, to guarantee a consistent user experience across various platforms. Testing was done on an Android phone to validate the app’s functionality and ensure that it performs well in real-world conditions. This step is crucial for identifying and resolving potential bugs or UI issues that could negatively affect user experience.

One of the challenges faced during development involved the display of weight data, as it was not appearing in the correct area on the app’s interface. This issue was resolved by adjusting the layout to ensure proper alignment and to improve the overall user interface. Despite this, the design process was particularly successful, especially when it came to the creation of a custom logo and the choice of cohesive colors, which gave the app a unified and visually appealing look. Overall, the Weight Tracking App successfully demonstrates my ability to design and develop an intuitive, user-friendly mobile app that meets the needs of users looking to track their weight and health goals effectively.
